# Automation of Indicators

### Objective: 
This project aimed to automate a computer-based process involving the calculation and dissemination of key performance indicators (KPIs) for a chain of clothing stores across Brazil.

### Description:

This project was developed to address the need for automating the daily calculation and dissemination of One Pages, which are concise summaries of KPIs for each store. The One Pages are sent to the respective store managers, providing them with a quick overview of their store's performance and enabling comparisons between different stores.

The automation process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Relevant data from each store, including sales, inventory, and customer numbers, is collected from various sources such as databases, Excel spreadsheets, and internal system APIs.

2. **Calculation of Indicators**: Using the collected data, the necessary KPIs for the One Page are calculated, such as daily sales, average ticket, and conversion rate.

3. **One Page Formatting**: The calculated KPIs are organized into a clear and concise format, creating a summary that provides a comprehensive view of each store's performance.

4. **Email Sending**: An automated process sends the One Pages to the managers of each store via email. The One Page is included in the body of the email, with the complete data file attached.

5. **Automation Scheduling**: The automation is scheduled to run daily in the morning, ensuring that managers receive updated One Pages at the start of the workday.

6. **Testing and Monitoring**: Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of each step in the automation process. A monitoring system was implemented to promptly identify and address any issues that arose.

With the successful completion of this project, the calculation and dissemination of One Pages have been streamlined, providing store managers with timely and actionable insights into their store's performance.
